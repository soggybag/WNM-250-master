                <h1>JavaScript - Selecting elements</h1>
            </header>
            
            <p>One of the most common tasks you will perform with 
            JavaScript is selecting elements. Elements are arranged
            and held in the DOM. For the most part you can select an 
            element similarly to haw you might select an element in CSS.</p>
            
            <p>getElementById()</p>
            
            <h2>jQuery</h2>
            
            <p>jQuery is a library of JavaScript code that adds many 
            helper functions to make your job of working with JavaScript
            easier. jQuery especially simplifies the selection of 
            elements by adding an easy to use system that relies on 
            the same selector syntax used by CSS. </p>
            
            <h3>Import jQuery</h3>
            
            <p>You link your HTML pages to jQuery in one of two ways.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Download and link to jQuery.js locally - This method 
                works offline, but would require you to keep track of the 
                extra file.</li>
                <li>Link to jQuery on the CDN over the internet - This
                method requires an internet connection, but you don't have 
                to keep track of any extra files. (Be sure to http: to the 
                link!)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Visit jQuery.com and click Download. For the examples here 
            I will use jQuery from the CDN. Copy the link and paste it into
            your page. </p>
            
            <h3>When does JavaScript run?</h3>
            
            <p>JavaScript runs as soon as the browser loads a script tag. 
            When placing the script tag at the TOP of the page this can 
            problems because the HTML elements lower on the page will not 
            have loaded yet! For this reason I will ask you always place 
            your script tags at the bottom of the page. </p>
            
            <p>Any scripts that will work with jQuery require that 
            jQuery be loaded first! Be sure to place the script that loads
            jQuery above any Scripts you write that will use jQuery. It's 
            problem best practice to load jQuery before all of your other 
            scripts.</p>
            
            <h3>Selecting elements</h3>
            
            <p>Use the $() method to select elements to work with. You can
            use any CSS selector string in this method. For example:</p>
            
<pre><code>$("#close-button") // Selects the element with the id name #close-button</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$("p") // Selects all p tags</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$(".box") // Selects all elements with the class name .box</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Adding and removing class names</h3>
            
            <p>A technique that I find has many practical applications is
            adding and removing class names. This is a simple concept that 
            has a wide range of usefulness. You can do many things with this
            idea. For example hiding and showing page content. Or 
            highlighting or showing an element as selected. Animating an 
            element into view, are a few ideas. </p>
            
            <p>The whole concept has a simple mechanism use JavaScript 
            to add or remove a class name from an element or group of 
            elements in your page. Connect the class name to styles in your 
            style sheet that change the appearance of the element. </p>
            
            <h3>.addClass("a-class-name")</h3>
            
            <p>Use jQuery's addClass() method to add a class name. Include 
            the class name as a string, do NOT prepend a dot (".")</p>
            
<pre><code>$("#header").addClass("code-red"); // Adds the class name code-red to the element with the id #header.</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$(".box").addClass("border-selected"); // Adds the class name border-selected to all elements with the class box.</code></pre>
            
            <h3>.removeClass("a-class-name")</h3>
            
            <p>The removeClass() method removes a class name from an element.
            This analgous to addClass(). </p>
            
<pre><code>$("#header").removeClass("code-red"); // Removes the class name code-red from the element with the id #header.</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$(".box").removeClass("border-selected"); // Removes the class name border-selected from all elements with the class box.</code></pre>
            
            <h3>.toggleClass("a-class-name")</h3>
            
            <p>The toggleClass() method adds a class when that class doesn't 
            exist, or removes the class if it does exist. Think of it as a 
            combination of both the addClass() and removeClass() methods with
            some added logic. </p>
            
            <p>Use toggleClass() to create things that toogle. When something 
            toggles it changes between two states, like a light switch. You 
            can use toggleClass() to easily create drawers that open and 
            close, custom switches and check boxes. </p>
            
<pre><code>$("#header").toggleClass("code-red"); // Adds the class name code-red if it doesn't exists to the element with the id #header, otherwise it removes the class code-red.</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$(".box").toggleClass("border-selected"); // Adds the class border-selected if does not exist, or removes it if it exists.</code></pre>
            
            <h3>.click(function)</h3>
            
            <p>Use the click() method to add a click event to an object. 
            Use this to add simple interactivity to your pages. </p>
            
            <p>The click() method takes a function as a parameter, and it
            passes to that function an event object.</p>
            
<pre><code>$("#header").click(function(event){
    $(this).toggleClass("code-red");
}); 
// Toggles the class code-red each time #header is clicked.</code></pre>
            
<pre><code>$(".box").click(function(event){
    $(this).toggleClass("border-selected"); 
});
// Toggles the class border-selected on the .box that was clicked. 
// The code here applies to all elements with the class name box. 
// The click action only applies to the single box that was clicked.</code></pre>
            
            <h3>this - ?</h3>
            
            <p>The keyword this is a special variable that represents the 
            current object. Use this to refer to an the element that owns
            the current function. In the forst example above you'll </p>

            <h2>Hiding and Showing the shopping cart</h2>
            
            <p>Use the examples to hide and show the shopping cart. 
            Use the technique presented here to add and remove a class name
            on the shopping cart container element. Use the styles 
            associated with the class name to hide or show the cart. A 
            good strategy would be to have the cart in a hidden state:</p>
            
<pre><code>display: none;</code></pre>
            
            <p>Use add a class to make it visible:</p>
            
<pre><code>display: block;</code></pre>
            
            <h2>Hiding and showing product details</h2>
            
            <p>Add a click action to each of your products that will 
            show the product in a detail view. </p>
            
            <p>Approach this by adding all of the product detail views
             to your page and making these hidden. Use the click method 
            to add a class that makes one of these detail views visible. </p>
            
            <h3>.attr("attribute-name")</h3>
            
            <p>Look at my example. I created a simple method to connect 
            each product with it's associated detail view. I used jQuery's 
            attr() method. This method returns the value of an attribute. 
            In this case it is the value of the href attribute of the 
            link (a tag) that was clicked. </p>
            
            <h3>Closing the cart</h3>
            
            <p>since the cart is a sinle object the close button can target 
            that element by an id name. </p>
            
            <h3>Closing the product details</h3>
            
            <p>For product details it would be cumbersome to write a close 
            function for each close button. We would need one function 
            for each detail view. It's better for us to write a generic 
            function that applies to all of the close buttons in all of 
            the detail views. </p>
            
            <p>jQuery helps us accomplish this with some it's other methods.
            To solve this we need the close button to look up the DOM 
            for the element nearest element for the element that we 
            can identify as the container for the detail view. In my 
            example this was: </p>
            
<pre><code>$(this).parents(".product-details").removeClass("show");</code></pre>
            
            <p>Here $(this) is the close button inside of the details views. 
            Clicking it looks up the DOM with the .parents() method. In this 
            I look at each parent trying to find an element with the class name
            "product-details". When I find that element I used removeClass() to 
            remove the class "show" and the element disappears. </p>
