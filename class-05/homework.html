            <p>Continue working on your shopping cart code. The goal is to create the necessary functions
            to add items to the cart arraym remove an item from the cart array, increase and decrease 
            the number of items in the cart.</p>
            
            <p>It is important to understand that at this stage the cart will only produce results to 
            the console. This is a okay. We are doing well, and our cart script is working well if it
            can run independantly of our interface. This allows the cart script to work with any interface
            and adapt to changes that might occur with the interface.</p>

            <header><h1>CSS position</h1></header>
            
            <p>Understanding CSS position is important to being able to place things anywhere on the page 
            in realtion to any other element. There are a few rules that govern CSS Position. Understanding
            these rules will make it easy for you to see where, when, and how to apply CSS position.</p>
            
            <h2>The position property:absolute</h2>
            
            <p>Absolute position allows the position of an element to be set by setting the: top, right, 
            bottom, or left edges of the element. While this makes sense at a glance, in practice it
            doesn't always work out as expected. The key feature to understand with absolute position is 
            where the coordintes are refrenced. In other words when setting the left edge of an 
                absolutely positioned element where do start measuring from? </p>
            
            <p>The answer is the realative ancestor. Normally what you will see an absolutely positioned 
            element sets it's position relative to the edges of the browser window. This is because, if 
            there are no other relative elements, the body tag is used as a reference. </p>
            
            <p>To create define a relative ancesstor set the position of your container to realative. 
            From here any descendant elements with the position: absolute will use the relative ancessestor
            as the reference. </p>

            <h3>Alternate product boxes</h3>
            <p>Create three alternate product box layouts. Look at your store. Examine the layout of each
            product. Imagine three alternate layouts for products. Think about moving the name and price. 
            Use absolute position for this. </p>

            <h3>Add badges</h3>
            <p>Create some badges and add these to products in your store. The badge should appear in one
            of the corners of the product box. </p>
            <p>Make three badges for products. These can be "featured", "On Sale", and "Best seller". You 
            can replace any of these with a badge of your own invention if you like. </p>
