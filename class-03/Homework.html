                    <h1>Shopping Cart - Form</h1>
                    <p>WNM 250 Assignment 3</p>
                </header>
                <p>The goal of this assignment is to create a shopping cart for the 
                store you created in the previous assignment. At this stage the shopping
                cart will not function, it only needs to mockup it's function. We will 
                be adding features to the project as we study JS with the goal of 
                making the cart functional.</p>
                
                <p>Your cart must have the following features</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Shows the Name of the item.</li>
                    <li>An input field showing how many of each item are in the cart.</li>
                    <li>Show the cost of each item.</li>
                    <li>Show the total cost of item (cost each * number of units).</li>
                    <li>A button to add one unit of an item.</li>
                    <li>A button to delete one unit of item.</li>
                    <li>A button to remove all units of an item from the cart.</li>
                    <li>Display total number of units in the cart.</li>
                    <li>Display the total cost of all units in cart.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Please look at the example (shopping-cart-example-markup.html) file for an idea of how these files 
                would be implemented. Pay close attention to the input tag and it's 
                attributes. </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Type - Sets the type for this input. Look into this and choose 
                    the type that is most appropriate.</li>
                    <li>Value - Sets the initial value.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Create your cart as a single HTML page. Style your
                cart with CSS. Make the cart display well at both 
                desktop and mobile sizes.</p>
                
                <p>This assignemnt should display the shoppig cart as it would work 
                with your Store page. It shouold share the same header, footer, and 
                other styles. </p>
                
                <p>Also take a close look at the data-name attribute. This is not a 
                standard HTML attribute. Instead this attribute was added by the 
                the developer to include more information with these tags. While this
                attribute is not used here, you will be making use if it in future 
                assignments. </p>
                
                <p>Include a link to the shopping cart in your store page. Turn in the 
                complete site, next week.</p>
