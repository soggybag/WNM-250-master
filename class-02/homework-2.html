                        <h2>Concept</h2>

                        <p>You will create a single web page for a store. Your store must present 
                        at least 12 products. Each product must have </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>name</li>
                            <li>image</li> 
                            <li>price</li>
                            <li>short description</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You can choose any subject you like for your store. It can sell any type of 
                        product that you want to work with. Do your best to fully conceive your site. 
                        Include a logo and footer, the page should look complete. Look at some sites that 
                        you might shop at for inspiration. Ask yourself what these sites include, and why.</p>

                        <p>Your site will be responsive, it should look good on the desktop, and 
                        on your mobile phone. Columns should change size, images should scale as the 
                        browser changes width. Your site will strive to make the best use of available 
                        space.</p>

                        <h2>Structure</h2>

                        <p>Create a single page with a fluid design. Your finished page should look
                        good at screen sizes for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Pay close 
                        attention to font sizes on smaller screens. Use the inspector in Chrome to 
                        test at mobile screen sizes or test on your own mobile device!</p>

                        <h2>Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Use all of the ideas from class. Use only class names for your styles.
                        Do not use id names. Use contextual tags, like section and aritcle. Do not add 
                        class names to these tags. Add class names to div, and other tags. </p>

                        <p>Use media queries to create styles that adpt for mobile. Use the ideas from 
                        class. </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>% width - to make elements flexible at different screen sizes</li>
                            <li>calc() - to make padding and margins play well with % widths</li>
                            <li>img 100% - To make images scale</li>
                            <li>@media - use media queries</li>
                            <ul>

                                <li>max-width: 767px - for styles that apply to mobile phones</li>
                                <li>Hide and show elements - for elements that would be hard to restyle</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Use only class names - Do not use ID names for styles.</li>
                            <li>Use contextual tags - Use the best, and most descriptive markup you can 
                                think of.</li>
                        </ul>
