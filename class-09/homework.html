            <h1>Solving problems</h1>
            <h2>Total cost for each item</h2>
            <p>The total cost for each item is calculated as the 
                price of the item times the count. You can calculate
                this as you loop through the cart. </p>
            
            <p>This code is probably best placed in </p>

            <pre><code>// Calculate the total price items in cart
// index.html 
for (var i in cart) {
    // Get the name, price, and count
    var name = cart[i].name;
    var price = cart[i].price;
    var count = cart[i].count;
    var total = price * count; // figure the total
    ... Add this item to the shopping cart display ...
}</code></pre>
            
            <h2>Get the total price of all items in the cart</h2>
            <p>To get the total cost of all items in the cart
            multiply the count by the price for each item and sum
            these all together. You will need a loop. The sum 
            variable needs to be placed outside the loop!</p>
            
            <p>This code can work anywhere in your. I placed
            this function in cart.js because it would be 
            easier to reuse from there. I also want to show 
            the cart total at the top of the page. </p>
            
<pre><code>// Returns the total cost for all items in cart
function getTotal() {
    var total = 0;  // Declare this variable outside of loop
    for (var i in cart) {
        total += cart[i].price * cart[i].count;
    }
    return total; // Return the total
}</code></pre>
            
            <p>Then call this function in your page.</p>

            <pre><code>// Display the total in the elements with the class names: .cart-total
$(".cart-total").html(getTotal());</code></pre>

            <h2>Get the total count for cart</h2>
            <p>here we want to know the total number of items in the cart.
            This will be a sum of the count for each item.</p>
            
            <pre><code>// Returns the total number of items in cart.
function getCount() {
    var total = 0; // Declare this outside of loop
    for (var i in cart) {
        total += cart[i].count;
    }
    return total; // Return the total
}</code></pre>

            <p>Use this method in your page like this:</p>
            
            <pre><code>// Displays the total number items in cart in the element #cart-count
$("#cart-count").html(getCount());</code></pre>

            <h2>Listening for events</h2>
            <p>As you dig deeper into JS you will run into 
                situations where you want to to listen for an
            event on an element and you are required to add the
            event before the element exists!</p>
            
            <p>Here is an example: </p>
            
            <pre><code>// The first line tries to add a click event
// To #a, but #a has not been created yet!
$("#a").click(function(){ /* some code */ });
// Creates #a, but it's too late #a does not get the click!
$("#container").html("&lt;button id='a'&gt;A Button&lt;/button&gt;")
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>This is exactly the situation with button in the cart!
            All of the elements in the cart are not created until
            something is added to the cart. Our JavaScript is run
            when the page is loaded, this is before a customer 
            has the chance to add anything to the cart. </p>
            
            <p>This situation will happen all the time! Be prepared 
            to solve this problem.</p>
            
            <p>The solution is to add a listener to an element 
            that exists, and filter the events for the elements
            that will exist in the future. Luckily for us jQuery
            has a simple solution that makes this easy to 
            implement. </p>
            
            <h3>on(event, filter, function)</h3>
            <p>The on() method is an advanced form of the click
            and other event handlers. Here is an example.</p>
            
            <pre><code>// Add a click event to the body tag
$("body").on("click", "#a", function(){ /* some code */ });
// Create #a later and the event above will find it
$("#container").html("&lt;button id='a'&gt;A Button&lt;/button&gt;")
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>In this example example the event is added to the
            body tag. So any clicks in the body, that is anywhere 
            on the page, will be received. These clicks are filtered
            for elements that match the description, in this case:
            elements with the id name:#a. If ther is a match the 
            function is run. </p>
            
            <p>This is is functionaly the same as the previous 
            example, and secretly the click() method uses on() 
            behind the scenes! So click() is just a simplified 
            version of on().</p>
            
            <h2>Add some buttons to the cart</h2>
            
            <p>The cart html can get fairly complex. Best to 
            organize how it is written in your code. I'd like 
            to recommend keeping each html element on it's own
            line, and using += to append each new thing to 
            your output variable. </p>
            
            <p>Here is a sample from my example: </p>
            
            <pre><code>
html += "&lt;li&gt;"+name+" $"+price+" x "+count;
html += "&lt;button class='add-one-item' data-name='"+name+"'&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;";
html += "&lt;button class='subtract-one-item' data-name='"+name+"'&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;";
html += " = "+(price * count);
html += "&lt;/li&gt;";
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>You can think of each line above as </p>
            
            <pre><code>
&lt;li&gt;Apple $0.99 x 3
&lt;button class='add-one-item' data-name='Apple'&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button class='subtract-one-item' data-name='Apple'&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
 = 2.97
&lt;/li&gt;
            </code></pre>

            <p>Which is how you might write this if it were 
            standard HTML. </p>
            
            <p>Look closely at the button tags. Notice I added 
            data-name to each of these. This way clicking on a 
            a button we can check the product name and add or 
            subtract a product with that name. </p>
            
            <p>To handle clicks on these buttons us on(). 
            Remember these buttons don't exist until something 
            is added to the cart, while the code that listens 
            for clicks on the buttons is added when the page loads!</p>
            
            <p>Note: the functions addItem(name), and 
            removeItem(name) need to be added. They appear in the 
            next section. The updateCart() method refers to the
            method that writes the cart into your page. You may
            have used another name for this. </p>
            
            <pre><code>
$("body").on("click", ".add-one-item", function(event){
    // Get the name of the item
    var name = $(this).attr("data-name");
    addItem(name);  // Add the item to the cart!
    updateCart();   // The contents of the cart have been changed update the cart
});

$("body").on("click", ".subtract-one-item", function(event){
    // Get the name of the item 
    var name = $(this).attr("data-name");
    removeItem(name);   // remove that item
    updateCart();       // The cart has been changed update it
});
            </code></pre>
            
            <h2>Adding and removing items from the cart</h2>
            
            <p>Adding and removing products from the cart is
            probably best handled from cart.js. I used these 
            funtions to handle adding and removig products from 
            the cart. </p>
            
            <pre><code>
// Add Item to the cart. 
function addItem(name, price, count) {
    var item = makeItem(name, price, count);
    for (var i in cart) {
        if (cart[i].name == item.name) {
            cart[i].count += item.count;
            return;
        }
    }
    cart.push(item);
}

function removeItem(name) {
    for (var i in cart) {
        if (cart[i].name === name) {
            cart[i].count -= 1;
            if (cart[i].count === 0) {
                cart.splice(i, 1); // Remove this item
            }
            return; // End the function here
        }
    }
}            
            </code></pre>

            <p>In both cases we need to search the cart for an
            item with the name that is passed into the function. </p>
            
            <h1>Homework</h1>
            <p>Make the cart system functional (mostly). You should be
            able to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add items to the cart.</li>
                <li>List the cart.</li>
                <li>The cart should show the name, cost, count, 
                    and total cost for each item.</li>
                <li>The cart should show a total cost for all 
                    items in the cart.</li>
                <li>The page should display the number of items 
                    in the cart. </li>
                <li>Each item in the cart should have buttons to 
                    add and remove items from the cart.</li>
                <li>Removing the last of an item in the cart 
                should remove that item entirely from the cart.</li>
                <li><strong>Use CSS to style all the cart!</strong>
                Style all of the elements, including the button!
                Make the cart listing look as good as you can.</li>
                <li>When there are no items in the cart your 
                page should handle this situation appropriately. 
                For example the cart button might be disabled, 
                or the cart might display a message like: 
                "You cart is empty"</li>
            </ul>
