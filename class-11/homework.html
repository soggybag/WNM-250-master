            <h1>Form elements</h1>
            <h2>input</h2>
            <p>The input tag creates a single line input or a submit 
            button. Yes, the input can also be a button.</p>
            <p>Input types can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>text</li>
                <li>number</li>
                <li>password</li>
                <li>url</li>
                <li>email</li>
                <li>date</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can listen for a "change" at an input. When the 
            value stored in the field changes JavaScript can respond
            to that change.</p>
            <p>With jQuery you can use the .("change") to listen 
            for changes in any form element.</p>
            <p>To get the value from a form element with jQuery
            use .val()</p>

            <h1>Homework</h1>
            <p>Work on the design of your site. The goal for the final
            is to complete the store and make it look and work like 
            real functioning online store, at least as far as you 
            can take it. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User test: find three other students and ask them
                to test your site. Give them a task, for example:
                "Find some shoes in the product list and add them to 
                your cart", and "Check the number of items in your 
                    cart, and the total cost". </li>
                <li>Get three feedback reviews on the UX and design
                of your store site. These should come from three 
                other students. The goal is to indentify areas
                where you can improve your site. </li>
