            <h1>Final Project</h1>

            <p>Your final project will be an online store. Your goal is to make
            this project as complete and well designed as you can. The end goal
            is to have a well designed and functional example you can add to your
            portfolio. </p>

            <h3>Features</h3>

            <p>Your final assignment should have the following features</p>

            <dl>
                <dt><H4>12 or more products.</H4></dt>
                <dd>Your site should display at least 12 products, more if you like.
                Each product should have a picture, a name or title, price, and
                description.</dd>
                <dt><H4>Products display on one page</H4></dt>
                <dd>All of your products should display on one page. Anyone
                should easily be able to spot a product, and see the name and
                price. </dd>
                <dt><H4>Product Details</H4></dt>
                <dd>Products should show a detail view with image, name, price, 
                and description.</dd>
                <dt><H4>Shopping cart</H4></dt>
                <dd>Your site should have a functional shopping cart. You should be able to add items to your cart, and remove items from the cart. The cart should should display the total number of items, and the total cost for all items.
                <p><strong>Rather than following this description to the letter, your site should present a usable and understandable shopping cart.</strong></p>
                <p>In other words the real requirements are, does the cart function as people would expect it to? Can you perform all of the functions that people might expect form the cart?</p>
                </dd>
                <dt><h4>Your site uses Templates</h4></dt>
                <dd>Your site should use templates where it makes sense. The two most likely places are the products list, and the products details. Another place the template would be useful is the shopping cart list. </dd>
                <dt><h4>Use CSS</h4></dt>
                <dd>Use CSS to animate elements on your site.</dd>
                <dt><h4>Use JavaScript &amp; jQuery</h4></dt>
                <dd>Use JavaScript and jQuery to manage the functions of your site. </dd>
                
            </dl>
