                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to program web browsers. 
                You can use it to do many things. It is one of the most popular 
                programming languages in use today.</p>
                
                <p>To work with JavaScript in an HTML page you can import your 
                JavaScript code with the script tag, or write JavaScript inside the
                script tag directly. This is much like using the link and style tags 
                use with CSS</p>

                <p>Study the concepts for class next week. Over the next couple weeks 
                you will be creating a functioning shopping cart. We will be following 
                the video tutorial series
                    <a href="https://github.com/soggybag/Shopping-Cart-js">here</a>. 
                Watch the first six videos. Your job is to try your best to follow the 
                these videos and create the examples presented. If you have problems
                along the way write them down, or save the problem file, and bring it 
                to class next week.</p>
                
                <h3>The JavaScript console</h3>
                <p>The videos above use the console to display results. The console
                is not displayed as a regular part of a web page. Instead the console
                is a tool for developers to test their work. The console can display 
                the results from your JavaScript. Think of the console as a window
                into the world of JavaScript. </p>
                
                <p>The command console.log("your message...") displays any message to the 
                the developer console in the browser. You will use this to display the 
                results of your JavaScript code.</p>
                
                <p>The console also displays error messages and warnings. You will use 
                    these to troubleshoot your code. While you work you should keep the 
                console open and look for error messages. The error message will descibe
                    the problem. On the right side the an 
                error will show the file where the error occured and the line number. 
                Use this information to help track down an error. </p>
                
                <p>The JavaScript console is located in different places in different 
                browsers. Be sure you can find the console in the browser you are wokring 
                with. </p>
                
                <h3>Safari</h3>
                <p>When using Safari the console, and other developer tools is not 
                availbel in the default mode. You will need to turn on the developer 
                options. Do this by choosing Safari > Preferences. In the preferences 
                panel, select Advanced. This the icon on the far right. Then check the 
                box at the bottom of the panel labeled: Show Develop menu in bar.</p>
                
                <p>From here you should be able to right, or control click in the browser
                and choose: Inspector. Alternately you can choose Develop > Inspector.</p>
                
                <p>Once the Inspector is open. The Console is located in the Tab on the 
                    right. </p>
                
                <h3>Chrome</h3>
                <p>In Chrome right click or control click in the browser window and 
                choose: Inspector. Alternately choose View > Developer > JavaScript 
                    Console.</p>
