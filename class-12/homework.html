            <h1>Organizing your project</h1>
            
            <p>Getting your files organized will help you make better web sites
            and while also making it easier to understand how your site operates.</p>
            
            <p>While starting out it might be easier to have all of the features 
            of your site, html, css, and JS, in one file. Over time this type of 
            organization becomes burdensome and leads to gigantic file which, 
            while you know everything is there, is hard to read. One of the easiest
            ways to get your web projects organized is to separate your HTML, CSS, 
            and JS into separate files. This also has the advantage making 
            some of your code portable later on. </p>
            
            <h2>Organize your files</h2>
            
            <h3>CSS - style.css</h3>
            <p>Move your CSS styles into a file named style.css. Save this into
            the same folder with your index.html. <strong>Do Not</strong> 
            include the &lt;style tag&gt;!</p>
            
            <p>Link to your style.css file by adding the link tag in the head of
            your index.html. This tag <strong>must</strong> use the rel 
            attribute with a value of <q>stylesheet</q>! Use the href attribute
            load style.css, be sure to use the correct path here!</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <h3>JavaScript - main.js</h3>
            
            <p>You will often be linking to more than one JavaScript file. 
            Usually many of the files are libraries of code you are getting 
            from somewhere else, like loading jQuery from the CDN for example. 
            Or they may be libraries of code that are not specific to this 
            project. For the JavaScript that specific to this project make a
            file named main.js. Save this file in the same folder as index.html</p>
            
            <p>For now consider it best practice to keep all of your script 
            tags at the bottom of your html page. </p>
            
            <p>Move all of the JS code you have in index.html into main.js. 
            Do not include the &lt;script&gt; tag!</p>
            
            <p>Link to main.js with the script tag. Be sure to place this tag
            <strong>last</strong> in the group of script tags.</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;script src="main.js"&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <h2>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</h2>
            
            <p>DRY is a computer programming concept that imparts good advice
            and best practice. Any time you find a place to apply the concept 
            you will be making better software, and making your work easier
            and more reliable. The idea of DRY is to not repeat blocks of code
            whenever possible. For example, rather than using an id on individual 
            elements that share the same CSS styles, you can apply a class name 
            and allow the elements to share the same style rules. This would 
            mean that you now only have to write these rules once.</p>
            
            <p>How and when you apply DRY to your work is up to you. You need to 
            examine your work and find opportunities where you can eliminate 
            repetition. You can apply DRY to your JavaScript by creating 
            functions to handle code blocks that you find yourself writing more 
            than once. You can also apply DRY to HTML by using Templates.</p>
            
            <h1>Templates</h1>
            
            <p>Templates are blocks of HTML can be called up or generated as 
            needed. You may have noticed that you often write the same block 
            of HTML code again and again only changing the content. This is 
            the problem templates are meant to solve. Imagine writing a 
            block of HTML only once, and filling in the content as needed, and 
            you will have the concept of Templating.</p>
            
            <p>Templating requires JavaScript or another active language. HTML
            can not handle templates by itself. There are many different 
            ways you can create templates, the items displayed in the shopping 
            cart could be considered a template. </p>
            
            <h3>Applying tempaltes to the Store</h3>
            
            <p>Stop a moment and examine your work. Ask yourself where you might 
            make use of templates. To do this look for blocks of HTML that are 
            repeated. </p>
            
            <p>Two areas where templates can be used are the products, and 
            product details. Each product is displayed in an almost identical 
            block of HTML, and the product details are the same. By replacing
            these with a template you will be saving time, and reducing the 
            amount code in your page. This will make your work easier, and more
            reliable. </p>
            
            <h3>Templating Libraries - Handlebars js</h3>
            
            <p>Many smart people have thought long and hard about this problem
            and come up with many ingenious solutions. For the example here I have
            chosen the Handlebars js library. Handlebars JS is easy to use and 
            has more features than we will use in this project. You can read more
            about Handlebars here: 
            <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">http://handlebarsjs.com</a></p>
            
            <h4>Handlebars Templates</h4>
            
            <p>A Handlebars Template is stored in a script tag. You'll give the 
            tag an id, and type attribute. The id will allow us to access the tag
            via JS, and the type will mark it a special type of script. Here is 
            a sample template: </p>
            
            
            <pre><code>&lt;script id="entry-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template"&gt;
  &lt;div class="entry"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div class="body"&gt;
      {{body}}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The template above would produce the HTML below:</p>
            
            <pre><code>&lt;div class="entry"&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;div class="body"&gt;
    Welcome to Templates!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
            
            <p>The HTML in the second block above is contained in the first. 
            Looking closely at the first block you will see that the first 
            block doesn't contain any content, and instead uses placeholders
            written something like: {{name}}. The {{ and }} are the "Handlebars".
            Think of these as variables. You will set the values placed inside
            the "handlebars" each time you create a copy of a template.</p>
            
            <h3>Compiling Templates</h3>
            
            <p>Before a template can be used you need to compile it.</p>
            
            <pre><code>var source = $("#entry-template").html();
var template = Handlebars.compile(source);</code></pre>
            
            <p>This creates a template function, named "template" in the example 
            above. This template function takes an object, and returns the 
            template HTML populated with values from the object. </p>
            
            <pre><code>var obj = {title: "My New Post", body: "This is my first post!"};
var html = template(obj);</code></pre>
            
            <p>In the example above the object: obj, has properties: title, and 
            body. The string returned from the function is the template with the 
            "handlebar" values replaced. </p>
            
            <h3>Site Data</h3>
            
            <p>An easy way to work with site data is to create an array of objects.
            Each object should have properties used in your handlebars templatess. 
            Here is an example:</p>
            
            <pre><code>var storeData = [
    {id:1,
    name: "Cat Fuzz",
    price: 123.12,
    desc: "Furry Fuzzy screeches",
    image:"images/01.jpg"},
    {id:2,
    name: "Tweedle Echo",
    price:132.32,
    desc: "If I've said it once I've said twice...",
    image:"images/02.jpg"}
];</code></pre>
            
            <p>This example defines an array containing two objects. Each object 
            contains properties:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>id</li>
                <li>name</li>
                <li>price</li>
                <li>desc</li>
                <li>image</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This JavaScript array and objects must be formatted correctly! 
            If not it will not work. Get comfortable with this. Be able to 
            solve any problems with formatting. Use the console to look for 
            errors. </p>
            
            <h1>Homework</h1>
            <p>Your store is due class 15. You should have tested
            this design some of your peers last week. Now it's 
            time to redesign and incorporate some of the feedback.</p>
            <p>As you are redesigning the visual component of your 
            project also rethink the HTML structure and code 
            behind it. Use the concept of templates covered this 
            week when you rebuild your site.</p>
            <p>Why rebuild your site? </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design - Face it your first answer might 
                often be right. Your first take on any design 
                problem is probably not your best work. </li>
                <li>Code - The best way to learn to code is to 
                practice. Rebuilding your site will give you a 
                chance to review everything you have leanred 
                this semester.</li>
                <li>New ideas - Recreating your site will give 
                you the opportunity to rethink how sites are 
                built and how they work. Compare the new ideas
                with your original approach.</li>
